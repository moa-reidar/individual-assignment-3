Project Overview
Planning and Structure

I began by outlining the key features and flow of the quiz application to ensure a seamless user experience. The project was divided into three main screens:  
- Start Screen: Welcomes users and initiates the quiz.  
- Quiz Screen: Displays questions with multiple-choice answers.  
- Result Screen: Shows the user's score and allows a review of answers.  

The design and functionality were planned to prioritize simplicity, responsiveness, and dynamic updates for a smooth interaction.

HTML Structure

Start Screen: Includes a title, description, and a "Start Quiz" button.

Quiz Screen: Displays the current question, multiple-choice answers, and a progress indicator.

Result Screen: Shows the final score and includes options to review answers or restart the quiz.


CSS Design

Modular CSS files for clean and maintainable styles:

reset.css: Standardizes default browser styles.

variables.css: Defines global design variables (colors, fonts).

style.css: Main styles for the application.

Focused on a simple, responsive layout for easy navigation on all devices.


JavaScript Functionality

Quiz Logic: Dynamically displays questions and tracks progress. Validates answers and updates the user's score.

Review Feature: provides a detailed review of the user's answers with correct/incorrect feedback.

Restart Functionality: Resets the quiz for a new attempt.
